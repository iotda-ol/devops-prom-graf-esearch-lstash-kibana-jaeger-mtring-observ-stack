# AlertManager Configuration - Simplified for Initial Deployment
# This is a minimal working configuration

# Global configuration
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

# Route tree for alert distribution
route:
  # Root route - default settings for all alerts
  receiver: 'default'
  group_by: ['alertname', 'severity']
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 12h

# Receivers - notification integrations
receivers:
  # Default receiver - logs alerts to console
  - name: 'default'
    # No external integrations configured yet
    # Add Slack, email, PagerDuty configs here when ready

# Inhibition rules - suppress certain alerts based on other alerts
inhibit_rules:
  # If critical alert is firing, suppress warning alerts for the same instance
  - source_match:
      severity: 'critical'
    target_match:
      severity: 'warning'
    equal: ['alertname', 'instance']
